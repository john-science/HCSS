# Hell Crawl Stone Soup (HCSS)

> Kill the dead. End their suffering.


## Standing Upon the Shoulders of Frost Giants

> HCSS is a fork of [Hellcrawl](https://github.com/Hellmonk/hellcrawl) which is a fork of [DCSS](https://github.com/crawl/crawl) v0.19.

On the off-chance it helps, you will find the full README for DCSS v0.19 [here](crawl-ref/README_DCSS_0.19.md) and the source code [here](https://github.com/crawl/crawl/releases/tag/0.19.6).


## Fewer Options, Hopefully More Story

HCSS is the game I want to play. It will be focus on an undead/unholy adventure. No spoilers, but including a story means reducing the amount of options the player has. You won't be
able to play a vampire or a mummy, that's for sure. And you will have to pick a "good" God to worship, or take none at all.


## Hellcrawl as a Starting Place

One of my personal design goals for HCSS is to have a simpler version of DCSS, with less tedium. As such, I decided to use [Hellcrawl](https://github.com/Hellmonk/hellcrawl) as my starting place.

I am sure I will make a ton of decisions in HCSS that the creators of Hellcrawl and indeed DCSS will not like. That's fine. The online gaming world is notoriously persnickety, and I won't defend my
choices. This fork is just for my own lawls, and I expect most people will continue playing the awesome games I forked from.

## Branch Map

Unlike DCSS, HCSS has a very linear branch map. Which we will share here, so no one gets confused.
